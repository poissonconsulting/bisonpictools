	abstract = {This book gives a unifying framework for estimating the abundance of open populations: populations subject to births, deaths and movement, given imperfect measurements or samples of the populations. The focus is primarily on populations of vertebrates for which dynamics are typically modelled within the framework of an annual cycle, and for which stochastic variability in the demographic processes is usually modest. Discrete-time models are developed in which animals can be assigned to discrete states such as age class, gender, maturity, population (within a metapopulation), or species (for multi-species models). The book goes well beyond estimation of abundance, allowing inference on underlying population processes such as birth or recruitment, survival and movement. This requires the formulation and fitting of population dynamics models. The resulting fitted models yield both estimates of abundance and estimates of parameters characterizing the underlying processes.},

	abstract = {Males of gregarious species of mammals often do not associate with female groups during the breeding season. Such males could leave groups either to search for new breeding opportunities, or to restore body condition before rejoining new female groups. To investigate these two competing hypotheses, we studied the chronology of male wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) associating with females, and their aggressive and sexual behaviour over two breeding seasons. With increasing age, males were more often solitary, were more involved in aggressive interactions, investigated the genitals of females more frequently, and tended females more often. Group size did not affect whether or not males joined or left groups. The presence of oestrous females in a group did not affect the number of bulls in that group, and did not affect the joining or leaving of males. Older, dominant males did not exclude younger ones from female groups. Males observed outside female groups spent relatively more time feeding and resting than bulls in groups. Changes in group composition experienced by a male often involved the joining or splitting of female groups, as opposed to actual transfer of males between groups. Our results suggest that males leave female groups in order to recover, not for the purpose of searching for new female groups. We argue that due to the fluidity of wood bison groups, it is possible for a male to encounter new females even when remaining in a female group.},
