<p>Alberta Environment and Protected Areas wishes to monitor the status
of the Ronald Lake wood bison herd in northern Alberta, Canada. A
combination of annual aerial surveys and camera traps along the herd’s
migration corridor have been used to collect data on the status of the
herd. The aerial surveys take place once a year, usually near the end of
March. These surveys produce estimates of the total herd size, as well
as the proportion of calves in the herd. The camera traps collect data
year-round, recording photographs upon the detection of nearby movement.
Researchers are able to classify the individuals in the photographs
captured during a camera trap “event”, here defined as a series of
photographs of the same group of wood bison in front of the same camera,
into classes by age and sex, as shown in Table 1. In the text to follow,
“bull(s)” will refer to the set of <span class="math inline">M2</span>,
<span class="math inline">M3</span>, and <span class="math inline">MA</span> individuals.</p>

<p>An integrated population model (IPM) was chosen to combine
stage-structured population projection matrix models with multiple
sources of data into a unified framework, allowing for estimates of
age-sex class ratios, population vital rates, and abundances, while
maintaining the correct propagation of uncertainty <span class="citation">(Schaub and Kéry 2022)</span>. The sources of data used
in this model include the classified counts from the camera trap events,
and two estimates derived from aerial surveys of the herd: a “census”
estimate of the entire herd size and an estimate of the proportion of
calves in the entire herd.</p>

Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#birth-age-incrementation-survival-bas-population-projection-matrix-model"></a>
</h3>
<p>Population projection matrices provide a simple way to model
population dynamics through time <span class="citation">(Newman et al.
2014)</span>. The population projection matrix summarizes the
probabilities of transitioning from each stage to every other stage,
using vital rates from demographic processes such as births, age
incrementation, and survival.</p>
<p>In this system, there are 8 stages, corresponding to the first 8 rows
in Table 1. The other classes in Table 1 do not represent true stages,
rather the individuals’ sexes and/or ages are simply unknown. The
abundances of each stage during the <span class="math inline">t^{th}</span> study year can be described by a
vector, <span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_t</span>, which is composed
of the numbers of individuals in each of the stages during that study
year (<span class="math inline">F0_t</span>, <span class="math inline">F1_t</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\mathbf{n_t} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    F0_{t} \\
    F1_{t} \\
    FA_{t} \\
    M0_{t} \\
    M1_{t} \\
    M2_{t} \\
    M3_{t} \\
    MA_{t} \\
\end{bmatrix}
</span></p>
<p>To ease model formulation, the population projection matrix can be
broken up into subprocess matrices <span class="citation">(Newman et al.
2014)</span>. Each subprocess has a separate matrix: in this model, the
<span class="math inline">\mathbf{B}</span> matrix describes the
stochastic birth process, the <span class="math inline">\mathbf{A}</span> matrix describes the deterministic
age incrementation process, and the <span class="math inline">\mathbf{S}</span> matrix describes the stochastic
survival process.</p>
<p>To get the vector of stage-wise abundances in the next study year,
<span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_{t+1}</span>, we multiply the
subprocess matrices together in reverse chronological order, and then by
the vector of stage-wise abundances in the current study year, <span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_{t}</span>. In this model, we assume that
survival occurs first, then age incrementation, and finally births,
resulting in the <span class="math inline">\mathbf{BAS}</span>
multiplication order. We also assume that the fecundity rate is fixed
and that the survival rates vary by study year.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\mathbf{n}_{t+1} =
\mathbf{BAS}_{t}\mathbf{n}_{t}</span></p>
<p>With the full population abundance vectors and subprocess matrices,
we arrive at the following:</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">f</span> represents the fecundity
rate, <span class="math inline">p_f</span> represents the proportion of
fecund <span class="math inline">FA</span> individuals, and each of the
<span class="math inline">\phi_t</span> terms represent the annual
survival rate of their respective stage. <span class="math inline">M2</span>s, <span class="math inline">M3</span>s,
and <span class="math inline">MA</span>s all share a survival rate,
<span class="math inline">\phi_{Bull}</span>. The <span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_t</span> stage-wise abundance vectors
represent the <em>expected</em> number of individuals in each stage in
the <span class="math inline">t^{th}</span> study year.</p>
<p>Diffuse priors were used to provide the model with stage-wise
abundances in the initial study year as a starting point. From there,
the population projection matrix was used to update the stage-wise
abundances in each subsequent study year. The study year was set to
begin on April 1 of each year because that marks the beginning of the
calving season. As such, the above process occurs at midnight on March
31 of each year.</p>
<p>Observations from camera traps occur throughout the study year, but
the above stage-wise abundance and proportion vectors are the expected
values on April 1. To ensure the correct abundances and proportions were
used to model this continuous data, the expected abundances and
proportions were calculated for the day of the study year of each camera
trap event. This involved using an exponential relationship between the
expected annual survival rate for the <span class="math inline">j^{th}</span> class, <span class="math inline">\phi_{j,t}</span>, and the day of the study year of
the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> camera trap event, <span class="math inline">d_i</span>, to calculate the expected survival rates
for the <span class="math inline">j^{th}</span> class on day of the
<span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> event, <span class="math inline">\phi_{i,j}</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\phi_{j,i} =
(\phi_{j,t})^\frac{d_i}{365.25}</span></p>
<p>These survival rates were used to update the abundances for each
camera trap event using a calculation similar to the projection matrix
above:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\mathbf{n_i} = \mathbf{S_in_t}</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_t</span> is the stage-wise
abundance vector in the study year of the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> camera trap event, and <span class="math inline">\mathbf{S_i}</span> is the survival matrix with the
updated survival rates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mathbf{S_i} =
\begin{bmatrix}
   \phi_{F0_i}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \\
   0 &amp; \phi_{F1_i} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0

</span></p>
<p>By dividing the expected abundance of the <span class="math inline">j^{th}</span> stage on the date of the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> camera trap event, <span class="math inline">\mathbf{n}_{j,i}</span> by the total expected
abundance on the day of the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span>
event (i.e., the sum of the stage-wise abundances), we can derive the
expected proportion of individuals in each stage on that day. The
proportion of the population represented by the <span class="math inline">j^{th}</span> stage during the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> event, <span class="math inline">p_{j,i}</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">p_{j,i} = \frac{\mathbf{n}_{j,i}}{\sum_{j
= 1}^J \mathbf{n}_{j,i}}</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">J</span> is the total number of
stages (8). The vector of these proportions, <span class="math inline">\mathbf{p}_i</span>, will be used to model the data
from camera trap events and the estimated proportion of calves from
aerial surveys. By rule, each vector of <span class="math inline">\mathbf{p}_i</span> values sums to 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="camera-trap-event-data">Camera Trap Event Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#camera-trap-event-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>We assume that each camera trap event represents a random draw from
the entire population, with the same expected proportions in the small
mixed groups captured in the cameras as in the overall population.</p>
<p>Several components of the model include seasonal variation. The three
seasons chosen for this herd are the calving season (April-June), the
summer/fall (July-November), and the winter (December-March).</p>
<p>Camera trap observations that occur during the calving season are
excluded from the analysis to avoid bias associated with uncertainty in
the transition period during which the calves start being classified as
yearlings, and because the herd migrates northward during the calving
season, away from the set of camera traps. To ensure that the survival
rates of the calves, <span class="math inline">\phi_{F0}</span> and
<span class="math inline">\phi_{M0}</span>, represent the true annual
survival rates, an additional probability of initial mortality of calves
was incorporated. This allows the calves to undergo higher mortality
when first born compared to the rest of the study year, which is more
biologically realistic.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">MA</span> individuals are known to go off
on their own or form small bachelor groups <span class="citation">(Komers, Messier, and Gates 1992)</span>. This was
accounted for in the model by assuming that only a proportion of <span class="math inline">MA</span>s are present in the mixed groups, and that
this proportion varies seasonally. This proportion will be denoted by
<span class="math inline">r_s</span> for the <span class="math inline">s^{th}</span> season. The <span class="math inline">MA</span>s are expected to spend more time with the
other members of the herd in the summer/fall than the winter <span class="citation">(Komers, Messier, and Gates 1992)</span>. Camera trap
events that detect only bulls are excluded from the analysis, because
they do not represent a random draw of individuals from the total
population.</p>
<p>An ideal way to model the camera trap data would be to use a
multinomial distribution to model the probabilities that the individuals
captured during a camera trap event belong to each of the stages.
However, a considerable percentage of individuals (~20%) were not sexed,
and were only classified as unknown calf (<span class="math inline">U0</span>), unknown yearling (<span class="math inline">U1</span>), or unknown adult (<span class="math inline">UA</span>). A series of binomial distributions were
used instead to model the count information (including the unsexed
individuals) and ratio information (excluding the unsexed individuals)
separately, in order to incorporate the valuable information contained
in these semi-classified individuals. The individuals that were sexed
but not aged (<span class="math inline">FU</span>, <span class="math inline">MU</span>; ~0.01%), or neither sexed nor aged (<span class="math inline">UU</span>; ~6%), were excluded from the
analysis.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="counts">Counts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#counts"></a>

<p>The total group size observed during event <span class="math inline">i</span> will be referred to as <span class="math inline">N_i</span>, excluding individuals with unknown

<p>To incorporate the unsexed individuals in each age class, we add all

<p>The proportion of individuals from each stage expected during the

to get the total expected proportions of calves, <span class="math inline">p_{C_i}</span>, yearlings, <span class="math inline">p_{Y_i}</span>, and adults, <span class="math inline">p_{A_i}</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">p_{C_i} = p_{F0_i} + p_{M0_i}</span> <span class="math display">p_{Y_i} = p_{F1_i} + p_{M1_i}</span> <span class="math display">p_{A_i} = p_{FA_i} + p_{M2_i} + p_{M3_i} +

<p>Each of the counts (<span class="math inline">C_i</span>, <span class="math inline">Y_i</span>, and <span class="math inline">A_i</span>) then follow binomial distributions, with

</h4>
<p>The ratios of certain stages were also included in the model in order
to incorporate the other information included in the fully-classified
(i.e., known sex and age) count data from the camera trap events.</p>
<p>For calves and yearlings, there are two stages, one for each sex,
allowing us to model the sex ratios with a binomial distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">F0_i \sim \text{Binomial}\Biggl(F0_i +
M0_i, \frac{p_{F0_i}}{p_{F0_i} + p_{M0_i}}\Biggr)</span> <span class="math display">F1_i \sim \text{Binomial}\Biggl(F1_i + M1_i,
\frac{p_{F1_i}}{p_{F1_i} + p_{M1_i}}\Biggr)</span></p>
<p>Three ratios were picked to ensure differences between all four of
the adult stages were accounted for. These were the <span class="math inline">FA</span>:Bull ratio, the <span class="math inline">M2:M3</span> ratio, and the <span class="math inline">MA:FA</span> ratio:</p>
<p><span class="math display">FA_i \sim \text{Binomial}\Biggl(FA_i +
M2_i + M3_i + MA_i, \frac{p_{FA_i}}{p_{FA_i} + p_{M2_i} + p_{M3_i} +

\text{Binomial}\Biggl(MA_i + FA_i,

<h4 id="covariance-structure">Covariance Structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#covariance-structure"></a>
</h4>
<p>Wood bison often travel in groups across the landscape. As such, the
counts and ratios of the events can be expected to be correlated through
time and space.</p>
<p>To account for this, a covariance structure was implemented into each
of the binomial distributional statements above. At a high level, this
involved incorporating a random effect for each camera trap location and
week, using a multivariate Normal prior with a covariance matrix that
allows the covariance between observations to decline exponentially with
the squared distance (in space and time) between them. The reader is
referred to Chapter 14.5.1 of <span class="citation">McElreath
(2020)</span> for more detail.</p>

<h3 id="census-data">Census Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#census-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The census data provided to the model includes the census estimate
and an associated coefficient of variation (CV), and the day, month, and
year of the aerial survey used to inform the census estimate.</p>
<p>To ensure the model relates correctly to the day the census estimate
was completed, a process identical to that described above for the
camera trap event data was done to calculate the expected stage-wise
abundances and proportions for the day of the study year of the <span class="math inline">a^{th}</span> aerial survey.</p>
<p>The census data was incorporated using a normal distribution as
follows,</p>
<p><span class="math display">C_a \sim \text{Normal} \biggl(
\sum_{j=1}^J \mathbf{n}_{j,a}, \sigma_{C_a} \biggr) \text{ T[0,
]}</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">C_a</span> is the census estimate in
the <span class="math inline">a^{th}</span> aerial survey, <span class="math inline">\sum_{j=1}^J \mathbf{n}_{j,a}</span> is the total
expected abundance on the day of the <span class="math inline">a^{th}</span> study year, and <span class="math inline">\sigma_{C_a}</span> is the standard deviation of the
census estimate (calculated as the product of the census estimate <span class="math inline">C_a</span> and its associated CV). The normal
distribution is lower-truncated at 0 to ensure that the abundance
estimates remain positive.</p>

<h3 id="calf-proportion-data">Calf Proportion Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#calf-proportion-data"></a>

<p>The data on the proportion of calves in the herd was incorporated
similarly,</p>
<p><span class="math display">P_a \sim \text{Normal}(p_{F0,a} +
p_{M0,a}, \sigma_{P_a}) \text{ T[0, 1]}</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">P_a</span> is the proportion of
calves estimate in the <span class="math inline">a^{th}</span> aerial
survey, <span class="math inline">p_{F0,a} + p_{M0,a}</span> is the
expected proportion of calves on the day of the <span class="math inline">a^{th}</span> aerial survey, and <span class="math inline">\sigma_{P_a}</span> is the standard deviation in the
estimate of the proportion of calves (calculated as the product of the
proportion of calves estimate <span class="math inline">P_a</span> and
its associated CV). The normal distribution is truncated at 0 and 1 to
ensure that the estimates remain on the probability scale.</p>

<h3 id="model-fitting">Model Fitting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-fitting"></a>
</h3>
<p>The model is fitted in Stan <span class="citation">(Carpenter et al.
2017)</span>. By default, <a href="https://github.com/poissonconsulting/bisonpictools" class="external-link"><code>bisonpictools</code></a>
uses “report” mode and a thinning rate of 10 to save 500 MCMC samples
from each of three chains (after discarding the first halves). To aid
with debugging, other analysis modes (“debug” and “quick”) can be set
(see the <a href="https://poissonconsulting.github.io/bisonpicsuite/articles/bisonpic-user-guide.html" class="external-link">user
guide</a> for more detail). The user can increment the thinning rate as
required to achieve convergence. The model-fitting process is automated
in the <a href="https://github.com/poissonconsulting/runbisonpic" class="external-link"><code>runbisonpic</code></a>
Shiny app.</p>

<h3 id="predictions">Predictions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#predictions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Predictions of the stage-wise and total abundances, survival and
fecundity rates, and select ratios are derived from the posterior
distributions of the estimated parameters. These predictions are shown
on March 31 of each study year, which is a stable point right before the
aging and birthing processes occur. The <a href="https://github.com/poissonconsulting/runbisonpic" class="external-link"><code>runbisonpic</code></a>
Shiny app also facilitates the visualization of these predictions.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions-and-limitations">Assumptions and Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assumptions-and-limitations"></a>
</h3>
<p>Key assumptions of the integrated population model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survival rates for each stage vary by study year.</li>
<li>The initial mortality rate of calves varies by study year.</li>
<li>The fecundity rate is fixed.</li>
<li>The proportion of <span class="math inline">MA</span> individuals
present with the mixed groups varies by season.</li>
<li>There is no grouping structure beyond what is accounted for by the
covariance.</li>
<li>Every stage is equally detectable during a camera trap event.</li>
<li>Small and large groups are equally detectable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key limitations of the integrated population model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A long run time; with ~500 camera trap events, the model takes
approximately 5 hours to converge.</li>
</ul>
